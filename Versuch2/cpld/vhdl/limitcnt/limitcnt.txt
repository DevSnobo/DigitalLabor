LIMIT COUNTER

This example is an extension of one  of the PREP benchmark circuits, PREP #2. The
primary pieces of the design are a 4-bit  loadable counter, a comparator, and a 
bidirectional bus interface. The bidirectional interface is implemented in the block
called BUSIFC, and includes a 4-bit register to hold the value endo.  A new  value 
can be written into the endo register by setting the csn and wen inputs low, and 
placing the new value on the bidirectional bus.  The current value of endo can be 
read back by setting csn low and wen high. This interface is capable of operating 
asynchronously from the clock.The aeqb output of the COMPARE block will go high each
 time that the value loaded into endo matches the current output of the counter, 
causing the counter to reload it’s initial value, which is 1.

Design Considerations illustrated by this example include:
1. How to combine VHDL sources and schematic sources in a design hierarchy.
2. How to implement both latch and register structures in synthesizable VHDL.
3. Using both module-level and device-level testbenches in a design.
4. How to handle bidirectional interfaces in VHDL testbenches.
5. A very simple VHDL testbench (counttb.vhd).
6. A complex, self-checking VHDL testbench (stimulus.vhd).
