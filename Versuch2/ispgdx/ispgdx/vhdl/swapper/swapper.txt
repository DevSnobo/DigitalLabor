 32-bit High Byte and Low Byte Swapper;

 dataA0 to dataA15 are low-byte of A-bus input signals;
 dataA16 to dataA31 are high-byte of A-bus input signals;
 dataB0 to dataB15 are low-byte of B-bus output signals;
 dataB16 to dataB31 are high-byte of B-bus output signals;

 oe0 is an enable signal that controls B-bus output signals;

 clk0 is the clock signal that triggers the registers of
 B-bus output signals;

 Data goes from A-bus to B-bus with swapped byte order when 
 oe0 is high (1) and clk0 jumps to high (1);
