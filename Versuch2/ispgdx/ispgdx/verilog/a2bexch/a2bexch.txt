 16-bit Data Exchange from A-bus to B-bus;

 dataA0 to dataA15 are A-bus bidirectional signals;
 dataB0 to dataB15 are B-bus bidirectional signals;

 oe0 is an enable signal that controls A-bus and B-bus;

 Data goes from A-bus to B-bus if oe0 is low (0);
 Data goes from B-bus to A-bus if oe0 is high (1);
